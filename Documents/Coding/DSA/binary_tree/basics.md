A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children:
	1.	Left Child
	2.	Right Child

It is widely used in searching, sorting, hierarchical data representation, and various algorithms.

1. Basic Terminologies

Before diving deeper, let’s understand some basic terminologies:
	•	Node: A fundamental part of the tree that contains data and pointers to child nodes.
	•	Root: The topmost node of a binary tree.
	•	Parent: A node that has child nodes.
	•	Child: A node that is derived from another node (its parent).
	•	Leaf: A node that has no children.
	•	Subtree: A tree formed by any node and its descendants.
	•	Height of a Node: The number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf.
	•	Depth of a Node: The number of edges from the root to that node.
	•	Height of a Tree: The height of the root node.
	•	Level: The depth of a node + 1.

2. Types of Binary Trees

Binary trees can have different structures based on node organization:

i) Full Binary Tree

A binary tree where every node has either 0 or 2 children (no nodes have a single child).
✅ Example:

       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \  / \
   4   5 6  7

ii) Complete Binary Tree

A binary tree in which all levels are completely filled except possibly the last, and the last level has nodes as far left as possible.
✅ Example:

       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \  /
   4   5 6  

iii) Perfect Binary Tree

A full binary tree where all leaf nodes are at the same level.
✅ Example:

       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \  / \
   4   5 6  7

For a perfect binary tree of height h,
	•	Total nodes = ￼
	•	Total leaf nodes = ￼

iv) Balanced Binary Tree

A binary tree is balanced if the difference between the height of the left and right subtree is at most 1 for every node.
✅ Example:

       1
      / \
     2   3
    /     \
   4       5

v) Degenerate (Skewed) Binary Tree

A tree where each parent node has only one child (like a linked list).
✅ Left Skewed:

   1
  /
 2
  /
 3

✅ Right Skewed:

   1
    \
     2
      \
       3

3. Binary Tree Traversals

There are mainly two types of tree traversal techniques:

i) Depth-First Search (DFS) Traversals
	1.	Inorder (Left, Root, Right)
	•	LNR: Left → Root → Right
	•	Used in Binary Search Trees (BSTs) to retrieve elements in sorted order.
	•	Example:

   1
  / \
 2   3
/ \


4   5

**Inorder (LNR) →** `4 2 5 1 3`


	2.	Preorder (Root, Left, Right)
	•	NLR: Root → Left → Right
	•	Used for creating a copy of the tree.
	•	Example:
Preorder (NLR) → 1 2 4 5 3
	3.	Postorder (Left, Right, Root)
	•	LRN: Left → Right → Root
	•	Used in deleting a tree (deletes child nodes before parent).
	•	Example:
Postorder (LRN) → 4 5 2 3 1

ii) Breadth-First Search (BFS) / Level Order Traversal
	•	Nodes are visited level by level from left to right.
	•	Example:
Level Order → 1 2 3 4 5

4. Properties of Binary Trees
	1.	Maximum Nodes at Level L = ￼
	•	Example: Level 2 has at most ￼ nodes.
	2.	Maximum Nodes in a Binary Tree of height h = ￼
	3.	Minimum Height for N Nodes = ￼
	4.	Number of Leaf Nodes in a Perfect Binary Tree = ￼
	5.	If a Binary Tree has L Leaf Nodes, then the total number of nodes N is at least 2L - 1.

5. Special Binary Trees

i) Binary Search Tree (BST)

A Binary Tree where:
	•	Left subtree has nodes with values less than the root.
	•	Right subtree has nodes with values greater than the root.
	•	Inorder Traversal of BST gives sorted order.

✅ Example BST:

      10
     /  \
    5   15
   / \  /  \
  2   7 12  18

Inorder Traversal → 2 5 7 10 12 15 18

ii) AVL Tree (Self-Balancing BST)

A BST with an additional property:
	•	Balance Factor of any node = Height(Left Subtree) - Height(Right Subtree) is either -1, 0, or 1.

iii) Heap
	•	Max Heap: Parent node is greater than its children.
	•	Min Heap: Parent node is smaller than its children.

✅ Max Heap:

      50
     /  \
   30    40
  /  \   /  \
10   20 15   35

✅ Min Heap:

      10
     /  \
   30    20
  /  \   /  \
50   40 35   15

6. Applications of Binary Trees
	1.	BST - Efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.
	2.	Expression Trees - Represent algebraic expressions ((A + B) * (C - D)).
	3.	Heap (Priority Queue) - Scheduling, graph algorithms (Dijkstra).
	4.	Trie (Prefix Tree) - Efficient searching in dictionaries.
	5.	File System Hierarchy - Used in directories and subdirectories.

7. Complexity Analysis

Operation	Best Case	Worst Case (Skewed)	Balanced BST
Search	O(log N)	O(N)	O(log N)
Insertion	O(log N)	O(N)	O(log N)
Deletion	O(log N)	O(N)	O(log N)

Since you now have a strong understanding of binary trees, let’s move on to solving problems like:
	•	Finding height of a tree
	•	Checking if a tree is balanced
	•	Traversal-based problems (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder)
	•	Constructing a tree from given traversals
	•	Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)
