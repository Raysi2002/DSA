# Doubly Linked List: Theoretical Explanation

A Doubly Linked List (DLL) is a type of linked list in which each node contains three components:
1. Data: The actual value stored in the node
2. Next Pointer: A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence
3. Previous Pointer: A reference to the previous node in the sequence

Unlike a singly linked list, a doubly linked list allows traversal in both forward and backward directions due to the additional previous pointer.

## Characteristics of Doubly Linked List

### 1. Bidirectional Traversal
- Nodes can be traversed in both forward and backward directions

### 2. Dynamic Size
- Like a singly linked list, it can grow or shrink dynamically without predefining its size

### 3. Efficient Insertion/Deletion
- Insertion and deletion are efficient at both ends (head and tail) and at any arbitrary position, requiring O(1) pointer adjustments

### 4. Extra Memory Requirement
- Each node requires extra memory to store the previous pointer

## Advantages of Doubly Linked List

### 1. Bidirectional Access
- Nodes can be accessed in both forward and backward directions, unlike a singly linked list

### 2. Efficient Deletion
- Deletion is simpler and faster since each node contains a pointer to its previous node

### 3. Easier to Reverse
- Reversing a doubly linked list is straightforward due to the previous pointer

## Disadvantages of Doubly Linked List

### 1. Increased Memory Usage
- Each node requires additional memory for the previous pointer

### 2. Complex Implementation
- Insertion and deletion involve more pointer adjustments compared to a singly linked list

## Structure of a Node in Doubly Linked List

```
+-------+--------+-------+
| Prev  |  Data  | Next  |
+-------+--------+-------+
```

- Prev: Points to the previous node in the list
- Data: Stores the actual data
- Next: Points to the next node in the list

## Key Operations

### 1. Traversal
- Forward Traversal: Start from the head and move using the next pointer
- Backward Traversal: Start from the tail and move using the previous pointer
- Time Complexity: O(n)

### 2. Insertion
- At the Beginning: Update the new node's next to point to the current head and the head's previous to point to the new node
- At the End: Update the tail's next to point to the new node and the new node's previous to point to the tail
- At a Specific Position: Adjust pointers of the surrounding nodes
- Time Complexity: O(1) for head or tail, O(n) for arbitrary position

### 3. Deletion
- From the Beginning: Update the head to point to the second node and set its previous to null
- From the End: Update the tail to point to the second-last node and set its next to null
- From a Specific Position: Adjust pointers of the surrounding nodes
- Time Complexity: O(1) for head or tail, O(n) for arbitrary position

### 4. Reverse
- Swap the next and previous pointers of each node
- Time Complexity: O(n)

### 5. Search
- Traverse the list to find a node with the desired value
- Time Complexity: O(n)

## Applications of Doubly Linked List

### 1. Navigation Systems
- Used in applications requiring forward and backward navigation (e.g., web browsers' back/forward functionality)

### 2. Undo/Redo Functionality
- Maintains a history of operations with backward and forward pointers

### 3. Cache Management
- Frequently used in implementing Least Recently Used (LRU) cache

### 4. Text Editors
- For maintaining the cursor position and text changes

## Comparison with Singly Linked List

| Feature | Singly Linked List | Doubly Linked List |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Traversal | One direction only | Both directions |
| Memory Usage | Less memory required | Extra memory for prev |
| Insertion/Deletion | Faster but limited | More flexible |
| Reversing the List | Difficult | Easier due to prev |

## Common Interview Questions

### 1. Basic Questions
- What is a doubly linked list? How does it differ from a singly linked list?
- Explain the advantages and disadvantages of a doubly linked list

### 2. Implementation Questions
- Write code to reverse a doubly linked list
- How would you insert a node in a sorted doubly linked list?
- Implement a function to delete the Nth node from a doubly linked list

### 3. Conceptual Questions
- Why is a doubly linked list preferred over a singly linked list in certain scenarios?
- How can you implement a circular doubly linked list?

### 4. Advanced Questions

- Special handling might be needed for operations involving the head or tail

### 3. Null Pointers

class Node {
    int data;
    Node prev;
    Node next;

    // Constructor
    Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.prev = null;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

class DoublyLinkedList {
    Node head;

    // Insert at the beginning
    void insertAtBeginning(int data) {
        Node newNode = new Node(data);
        if (head != null) {
            newNode.next = head;
            head.prev = newNode;
        }
        head = newNode;
    }

    // Insert at the end
    void insertAtEnd(int data) {
        Node newNode = new Node(data);
        if (head == null) {
            head = newNode;
            return;
        }
        Node temp = head;
        while (temp.next != null) {
            temp = temp.next;
        }
        temp.next = newNode;
        newNode.prev = temp;
    }

    // Display the list forward
    void displayForward() {
        Node temp = head;
        while (temp != null) {
            System.out.print(temp.data + " <-> ");
            temp = temp.next;
        }
        System.out.println("null");
    }

    // Display the list backward
    void displayBackward() {
        if (head == null) return;
        Node temp = head;
        while (temp.next != null) {
            temp = temp.next;
        }
        while (temp != null) {
            System.out.print(temp.data + " <-> ");
            temp = temp.prev;
        }
        System.out.println("null");
    }
}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DoublyLinkedList dll = new DoublyLinkedList();
        dll.insertAtBeginning(10);
        dll.insertAtEnd(20);
        dll.insertAtEnd(30);
        dll.displayForward();  // Output: 10 <-> 20 <-> 30 <-> null
        dll.displayBackward(); // Output: 30 <-> 20 <-> 10 <-> null
    }
