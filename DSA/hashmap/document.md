### General Concept of HashMaps

A **HashMap** is a data structure that stores data in the form of **key-value pairs**. It allows for fast retrieval, insertion, and deletion of elements, making it widely used in programming. The underlying mechanism of a HashMap involves **hashing**.

#### General Features of HashMaps:
1. **Key-Value Pair Storage**:
   - Every piece of data is stored with a unique key that maps to a value. For example, in a dictionary, the word is the key, and its definition is the value.

2. **Fast Access**:
   - HashMaps offer efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion, typically in **O(1)** time on average.

3. **Hashing**:
   - A **hash function** converts keys into integers (hash codes), which determine where the key-value pair is stored in the map.
   - This mechanism reduces the time complexity for operations.

4. **Collision Handling**:
   - When two keys produce the same hash code, a **collision** occurs. Common strategies to resolve collisions include:
     - **Chaining**: Storing multiple elements in the same bucket using a list or another data structure.
     - **Open Addressing**: Finding another open slot for the colliding entry.

5. **Real-World Analogy**:
   - Think of a **locker system** where each locker (key) stores a unique set of items (value). The hash function determines which locker to use based on the key.

### HashMap in Java

In Java, `HashMap` is a concrete implementation of the `Map` interface, part of the `java.util` package.

#### Key Features:
1. **Key Characteristics**:
   - Keys must be unique.
   - Keys can be `null` (only one `null` key is allowed).

2. **Value Characteristics**:
   - Values can be duplicate.
   - Multiple keys can map to the same value.

3. **Basic Operations**:
   - `put(K key, V value)`: Adds or updates a key-value pair.
   - `get(K key)`: Retrieves the value for a given key.
   - `remove(K key)`: Removes a key-value pair.
   - `containsKey(Object key)`: Checks if a key exists.
   - `containsValue(Object value)`: Checks if a value exists.
   - `size()`: Returns the number of key-value pairs.

4. **Internal Working**:
   - Uses an array of **buckets** to store key-value pairs.
   - The key’s `hashCode()` determines the bucket index.
   - If multiple keys map to the same bucket (collision), they are stored in a linked list or a balanced tree (since Java 8).

### Things to Know Before Solving HashMap Problems

1. **Understand Hashing**:
   - Grasp how the `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods work.
   - Ensure keys are immutable (e.g., `String`, `Integer`) for consistent behavior.

2. **Collision Handling**:
   - Understand how collisions are handled in Java (chaining or tree structure for buckets with many entries).

3. **Order**:
   - Know that `HashMap` doesn’t maintain order.
   - Use `LinkedHashMap` for maintaining insertion order and `TreeMap` for sorted order.

4. **Null Keys and Values**:
   - `HashMap` allows one `null` key and multiple `null` values.

5. **Performance**:
   - Average time complexity for `get()` and `put()` is O(1).
   - Worst-case (e.g., poor hash function): O(n) due to collisions.

6. **When to Use**:
   - Use when you need quick access to data via a key.
   - Avoid when you need ordered traversal.

7. **Avoid Pitfalls**:
   - Always override `hashCode()` and `equals()` when using custom objects as keys.
   - Ensure thread safety using `Collections.synchronizedMap()` or `ConcurrentHashMap` if needed.
