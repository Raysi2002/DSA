	7.	Evaluate Postfix Expression
	•	Input: "231*+9-"
	•	Output: -4
	8.	Implement a Min Stack
	•	Create a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
	9.	Implement Queue using Two Stacks
	•	Simulate a queue using two stacks with efficient enqueue and dequeue operations.
	10.	First Negative Integer in Every Window of Size K
	•	Input: [12, -1, -7, 8, -15, 30, 16, 28], k = 3
	•	Output: [-1, -1, -7, -15, -15, -15]

Advanced Questions

	•	Output: 10
	12.	Sliding Window Maximum
	•	Input: [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7], k = 3
	•	Output: [3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7]
	13.	Trapping Rainwater
	•	Input: [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
	•	Output: 6

	•	Input: [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85]
	•	Output: [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]

Real-World Scenarios
	16.	Design a Browser History (Back and Forward Buttons)
	•	Use stacks to simulate browser history navigation.
	17.	Implement LRU Cache
	•	Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache using a queue or a combination of a stack and a hashmap.
	18.	Generate Binary Numbers from 1 to N using a Queue
	•	Input: N = 5
	•	Output: [1, 10, 11, 100, 101]
	19.	Validate Stack Sequences
	•	Input: pushed = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], popped = [4, 5, 3, 2, 1]
	•	Output: true
	20.	Expression Conversion (Infix to Postfix and Prefix)
	•	Convert an infix expression like "a+b*(c^d-e)^(f+g*h)-i" to postfix and prefix.

How to Practice
	1.	Start with implementation problems to understand the fundamentals.
	2.	Progress to algorithmic problems like Next Greater Element or Trapping Rainwater.
	3.	Tackle real-world scenarios like LRU Cache or Browser History for a deeper understanding.
