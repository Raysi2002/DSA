Problem: Sorting of Zeros, Ones, and Twos

Solution Code

```//Optimal Solution (Dutch National Flag Algorithm)
public static int[] optimalSort(int[] arr) {
    int low = 0, mid = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
    while (mid != high + 1) {
        if (arr[mid] == 0) {
            int temp = arr[mid];
            arr[mid] = arr[low];
            arr[low] = temp;
            low++;
            mid++;
        } else if (arr[mid] == 1) {
            mid++;
        } else {
            int temp = arr[high];
            arr[high] = arr[mid];
            arr[mid] = temp;
            high--;
        }
    }
    return arr;
}```


Description
	â€¢	Problem Summary:
	â€¢	Sort an array containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s in ï¿¼ time complexity using an in-place algorithm.
	â€¢	Approach:
	â€¢	Dutch National Flag Algorithm:
	â€¢	Use three pointers:
	â€¢	low â†’ Boundary for 0s.
	â€¢	mid â†’ Current element pointer.
	â€¢	high â†’ Boundary for 2s.
	â€¢	Logic:
	â€¢	If arr[mid] == 0:
	â€¢	Swap arr[mid] and arr[low], then increment low and mid.
	â€¢	If arr[mid] == 1:
	â€¢	Increment mid.
	â€¢	If arr[mid] == 2:
	â€¢	Swap arr[mid] and arr[high], then decrement high.
	â€¢	Key Observations:
	â€¢	Maintains three partitions dynamically:
	â€¢	[0 to low-1] â†’ Sorted 0s.
	â€¢	[low to mid-1] â†’ Sorted 1s.
	â€¢	[high+1 to end] â†’ Sorted 2s.
	â€¢	Single traversal avoids unnecessary overhead.
	â€¢	Time Complexity:
	â€¢	ï¿¼: Single pass through the array.
	â€¢	Space Complexity:
	â€¢	ï¿¼: In-place swaps, no additional space.
	â€¢	Key Concept:
	â€¢	Dutch National Flag Algorithm is an efficient way to handle partitioning and sorting problems with fixed categories.
